# OS-FINAL-PROJECT
## Rikki Mann, Rikki Genack and Elisheva Goldfarb final project for OS. 

### Write what you did or what you are working on here.
___

* Rikki Genack: I started creating the files and adding some code, 
    I didn't have so much time, so I left comments etc. so we can continue

* Elisheva Goldfarb: I added the Slave A and connected it to main

* Elisheva Goldfarb: I think the job list class will work better than ArrayListA, 
also it'll be reusable for all slaves.

* Created the BooleanWrapper and thread M->S, C->M
