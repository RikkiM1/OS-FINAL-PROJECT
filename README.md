# 🏁 OS-FINAL-PROJECT 🏁
## Rikki Mann, Rikki Genack and Elisheva Goldfarb final project for OS. 

### 📝 Write what you did or what you are working on here.
___

* Rikki Genack: I started creating the files and adding some code, 
    I didn't have so much time, so I left comments etc. so we can continue

* Elisheva Goldfarb: I added the Slave A and connected it to main

* Elisheva Goldfarb: I think the job list class will work better than ArrayListA, 
also it'll be reusable for all slaves.

* Created the BooleanWrapper and thread S's M->S, C's C->M

### ✅ Write what should be worked on next on here.
___
- [x] Set up Slave B the class and in main
- [ ] Figure out loop for master to connect to multiple clients 
- [x] Create JobList Object in all classes (not client)
- [ ] Create thread classes 🧵
  - [ ] Slave Threads
    - [x] From Master
    - [ ] To Master (currently set up in main of slave A should be moved)
      - Fields: 
        - PrintWriter
        - JobList
        - BooleanWrapper
  - [ ] Client Threads
    - [x] To Master
    - [ ] From Master (Maybe do in main?)
  - [ ] Master Threads
    - [ ] From Slave/To Client
    - [ ] From Client/To Slave
- [x] Set up the logic to dynamically set the job id counter in client
- [ ] Check the current thread syntax make sure it is correct
